          etc. js developer enjoy being confronted with fresh issues and
          challenges since they advance my career. I'm upbeat, helpful, focused

          I have expertise with a variety of technologies, including UI design,
          bootstrap, Git, and javaScript and React.js. I'm always amazed of the
          seemingly endless possibilities in the field of software development.
          There is no greater feeling than taking a concept you have in your
          brain and utilising your technical knowledge to bring it to life in
          front of you. I would like becoming a part of an innovative,
          cooperative team that focuses on the team.
